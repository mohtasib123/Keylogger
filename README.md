# Keylogger
Keyloggers are programs designed to record your keystrokes, often used to log everything typed on a keyboard. However, they can also be exploited for malicious purposes.

The keylogger I developed is a simple version with limited features compared to those on the market. It records keystrokes and stores them in a file called "keylogger.txt."

Additionally, it emails the contents of this file (i.e., the captured keystrokes) to your specified email address.
